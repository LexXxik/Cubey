# Cubey
Android game that I created in 2018 (see [demomstration](https://youtube.com/shorts/o1xHE0te7rs?si=XXTlO99SzAgzSSZ1)). It is an endless run game where you play as a cube. The goal is to evade obstacles (jump, dash to the side) and collect coins. The game features a procedurally generated map and cool animations. Beware, the more coins you collect the faster it gets!!!
